https://www.kaggle.com/sherrysheng97/srnn-training-data-dho

These are JSON files. Each JSON file corresponds to an object, with the combination of different bands and five cadence strategies.

##### Simulated AGN parameters by CARMA

This large dataset includes DRW, DHO-underdamped, DHO-overdamped cases parameter sets.

For each simulated dataset, id, CARMA parameters, redshift, ra and dec are provided.

##### CARMA parameters recovery based on SRNN and LSST
